# README

You can create vampires and hunters with whatever stats you choose and pin them against each other

A hunter must have a weaopn, and a vampire an ability or else they cannot fight(will cause an error, need to change that)

Create a weapon in "The Holy Arsenal -> Add Weapon To The Armory " and an ability in "Vampiric Powers -> Add An Ability To The Spell Books"

Fight With "Organize A Hunt" or "Seek Out Prey"
